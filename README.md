  Budget Tracker

  ## Overview 
 Keeping track of your funds can help any person stay financially ahead through careful spending however it can be difficult to remember every purchase and every deposit. This budget tracker helps keep a log of your transactions while also updating the amount of funds you have afterwards. In case you need to log a transaction while no internet service is available the app works offline as well.
